**SRE introduction**
- What is the role of SRE?<br/>
Making the software development process and the end product more reliable, scalable. SRE-s can improve every stage of development and operations.


**Cloud computing with AWS** <br/> - What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?<br/> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, 
networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. <br/>Top benefits:
- Reduces cost
- Increases speed 
- Global scale
- Productivity
- Performance
- Reliability
- Security

**What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- What is AWS and benefits of using it? <br/>
Amazon web service is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. <br/>
Top benefits: <br/>
- Easy to use
- Flexible
- Cost-effective
- Reliable
- Scalable
